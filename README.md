# Final Assessment Project


 
## Project Description
I made an online book store for my final project. It is interactive and a cute design layout. 


# #Navigation 
When you come to the page for the first time you will come to a site where there is a container that explains what this site is and a small description of what to to expect from the site. When click on the button, you will enter the online store where you can scroll and look through different genres of books. You can click on the different genres at the top and page will scroll down to that section for you. If you want to go up to the top again, there is an arrow on the side of the page where it will scroll up to the top for you. You can also search for book title and author if there is a specific book you are looking for.  You can add them to your basket and the basket button will state how many books you have. When clicking on the basket you will see what book you have added and how much the total price will be. You will also be able to go back to shopping page again if you click on the link in the header. To confirm order, you will have to click on the button down on the page and you will be sent to a form page. Here you add all the contact details and when that is filled in, you can click confirm and an alert will pop up that it has been ordered.
